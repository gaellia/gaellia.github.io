                <p>Look at this beautiful blurred piano. Jenny thought so too. Alas,
                    poor Jenny attended concert after concert to find that everyone
                    around her was much more talented than she ever could be. Jenny, like
                    Ariel the Little Mermaid, wanted more. She wanted to be where the people
                    are, and make them dance and sing.
                    But Jenny was too poor to find a teacher who could make her
                    the virtuso she wanted to be. Jenny also had no time on
                    her hands. All her friends could play the first 8 measures of Fur
                    Elise, but Jenny had no time to learn that. Instead, Jenny took
                    it one step further. With a bit of practice,
                    Jenny learned a simple trick to impress her friends. Teachers hate her!
